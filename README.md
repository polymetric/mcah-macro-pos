# mcah-macro-pos
Minecraft Fabric mod created for the pack.png seed finding project.

It's a hacky thing I put together. Basically, It makes you look in a certain direction, takes a screenshot, increments your rotation by a specified number of degrees, then repeats. The purpose of this is to help determine what pitch and yaw was used for the original pack.png image. I only really made this because there isn't a viable macro mod for 1.15.2.

Oh, also, you press R to make it start and stop taking screenshots. Currently you can only change the yaw and pitch range in the source code.
